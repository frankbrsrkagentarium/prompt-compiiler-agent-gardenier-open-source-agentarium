# prompt-compiiler-agent-gardenier-open-source-agentarium
Gardenier is a prompt compiler that turns rough user intent into clean, structured, and policy-aware prompts using a modular rule + template stack and an optional “Master Grid” (atoms + edges) for retrieval and graph expansion. Includes source datasets, atomized node tables, and cross-dataset links for reproducible prompt assembly.
